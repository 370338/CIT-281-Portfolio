Lab-01
https://github.com/370338/Lab-01.git
Lab 1 aims to guide students through the installation and setup of essential software tools required for a course. The lab covers various aspects, including installing software tools, practicing using them, working with terminal commands and keyboard shortcuts, and creating a Node.js server-side JavaScript file. The completion of this lab helps students understand the course material, complete lab tasks, and prepare for future projects. The lab requires students to carefully read and follow the instructions, install the specified software tools, and submit the required deliverables as part of Project 1.

P1
https://github.com/370338/P1.git
The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with various aspects of web development, including accessing the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system, working with CLI commands, using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for coding and debugging, and writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code. The project involves creating folder structures, listing folders in a tree-like structure, practicing ping commands, and developing JavaScript programs to output the day of the week and generate random strings. The deliverables include a compressed folder containing the project files, lab deliverables, and screen captures.

Lab-02
https://github.com/370338/Lab-02.git
Lab 2 aims to familiarize students with using CLI commands and Git for file and directory manipulation. The lab covers various topics such as setting up Git user credentials, creating a new Git repository, adding files to Git, ignoring files using a .gitignore file, using the diff command to view changes, utilizing wildcards for staging files, cloning remote repositories locally, understanding branches, and listing tracked files in a repository. The lab includes step-by-step instructions for each part and concludes with a deliverable to be submitted along with Project 2. It is important to note that the lab may not be completed entirely during the lab session, and any remaining parts are expected to be completed independently.

P2
https://github.com/370338/P2.git
This project aims to provide hands-on experience with Git, JavaScript programming, and refactoring code. It involves creating and working with a Git repository, refactoring a JavaScript program, using Git via Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and implementing function expressions.

Lab-03
https://github.com/370338/Lab-03.git
The purpose of this project is to practice refactoring JavaScript code using modern syntax, object destructuring, arrow function expressions, for..in and for..of loops, creating and importing Node.js modules, and utilizing the spread operator. The project also includes a deliverable for Project 3.

Lab-04
https://github.com/370338/Lab-04.git
The purpose of this project is to create a Fastify Node.js web server, initialize it as a Node.js project, add Fastify using npm, set up a git repository while excluding the node_modules folder, fix a MIME error, add a second route with query parameters, and make commits. The deliverable for this project will be a compressed folder (lab-04.zip) containing lab files excluding node_modules.

P3
https://github.com/370338/P3.git
The purpose of this project is to create a coinage code module in Node.js that can calculate the total value of coin objects. It also involves creating a web server using the Fastify package to display a web page with links to test the coinage code.

Lab-05
https://github.com/370338/Lab-05.git
This project involves creating a server application using Node.js and Fastify, implementing GET and POST routes, and testing the functionality using Postman. The goal is to respond with JSON data and handle CRUD operations for a collection of student objects. The deliverables include the server file, package.json, and screenshots of Postman tests.

P4
https://github.com/370338/P4.git
The purpose of this project is to create a REST API that interacts with a data source of questions and answers. The project involves creating code modules to handle different functionalities, testing the code modules, and creating a Node.js REST API server to handle GET requests. Optional extra credit tasks include implementing POST, PUT, and DELETE functionalities.

P5
https://github.com/370338/P5.git
This project is an extra credit assignment that involves creating a Monster Game program using classes in JavaScript. The game generates monsters with initial life values and drains their life by random amounts until all the monsters have died.

Lab-06
https://github.com/370338/Lab-06.git
This project involves creating a digital book library using JavaScript classes. It includes tasks such as joining GitHub, creating and testing the Book and Library classes, adding books to the library, and implementing features like ISBN and a delete book method. The completed files should be submitted as a compressed folder called lab-06.zip for Project 5.

Lab-07
https://github.com/370338/Lab-07.git
This project involves creating a GitHub organization for the CIT Minor, creating a GitHub repository, cloning the repository to a local system, creating and initializing a Node.js folder, updating and committing a JavaScript file for error handling, and pushing the changes to GitHub. The deliverable for this lab is a compressed folder (lab-07.zip) containing the lab files.

P6
https://github.com/370338/P6.git
This project involves creating three classes: Shape, Rectangle, and Triangle. The Shape class is the base class for the other two classes, and the project focuses on implementing methods to calculate the perimeter and area of shapes based on their dimensions.

Lab-08
https://github.com/370338/Lab-08.git
The purpose of this lab is to learn and practice using the Fastify framework and the node-fetch package in Node.js. The lab involves setting up a Fastify server, making HTTP requests using node-fetch to retrieve photo data from the JSONPlaceholder API, and handling the responses to return appropriate status codes and data.

Lab-09
https://github.com/370338/skills-release-based-workflow.git
https://github.com/370338/Lab-09.git
The purpose of this project is to work through the GitHub Learning Lab course "Create a release based workflow" to learn about release workflows on GitHub. The lab involves creating a course repository, practicing exiting and returning to the course, working through the course steps, and downloading the completed course repository as a deliverable.

P7
https://github.com/370338/CIT-281-Portfolio/blob/main/README.md
The purpose of this project is to create an initial version of a CIT Minor portfolio using GitHub Pages. This involves creating a GitHub Page as the entry web page for the portfolio, creating repositories for each lab and project, creating GitHub Pages for each lab and project with descriptions and screenshots, and organizing the content on the portfolio page.
